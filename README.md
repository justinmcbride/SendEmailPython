In order for this to work you have to set up permission for Python to sign into your Google account and send the Email. This is done in the Security settings under your Google account.

Go to your Google account and select the "Security" tab in the left hand menu.

Then scroll down to the section called "Signing in to Google". Here enable "2-step Verification" by following the steps prompted by Google. If you already have "2-step Verification" enabled you can skip this step.

Then select "App Passwords", Google will prompt you to sign in to your account again, do that. Now we need to create a custom password for Python to sign into your account. Click the "Select App" drop-down menu, and then select "Other (custom name)", then add the name of the service (mine is just called Python). Leave "Select device" blank and click "Generate".

Google will now generate a custom password for Python to use when signing into your account. Copy this password (it wonâ€™t show again). This is the password you set as "Password" in the script on line 8.
